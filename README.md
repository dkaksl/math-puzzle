Math puzzle (6 simultaneous equations and 8 variables)

This project is a stub made with the intentions of porting my other project, [chinese-simultaneous-equations-puzzle](https://github.com/dkaksl/chinese-simultaneous-equations-puzzle) to a frontend app.

Currently, it's a very basic, vanilla HTML/JS app that can add random numbers or clear them.

Expect updates in the standard 6 to 8 weeks.
